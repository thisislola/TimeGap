# TimeGap

TimeGap is a super lightweight, single-file HTML _tool_ designed for quickly converting timestamps and calculating time differences between two or more points in time.
It is built for simplicity, portability, and full offline use—perfect for air-gapped environments or situations where installing software isn’t an option.

In the world of forensics, I like to have my tools and files in a USB (because you never know what device you'll need to access!) therefore I made this with that in mind.

Just open the file in a browser and start calculating. It is based on the device's time ✅

🗂 Usage

1. Download or copy the timegap.html file.
2.	Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3.	Enter timestamps in the supported formats.
4.	View conversions or calculate the gaps between timestamps.

No installation, no dependencies, no setup.

TimeGap **does not**:

- ❌ Fetch anything from the internet
- ❌ Use external scripts or APIs
- ❌Require modules, servers, or package managers

Everything is handled locally within the browser!
